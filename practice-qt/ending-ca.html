              The qualifying tests used in our selection activity are scored automatically. The pass mark for each test is determined by how candidates’ scores are grouped once the test is completed. The pass mark is specific to each exercise as it depends on how strong the candidate field is and how many roles are available. We will look at the number of roles available to decide how many candidates will progress to interview. Usually two or three candidates for each post are interviewed. A minimum score of 30% on each part of the multiple- choice test is always needed to progress to the next stage. 
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body-m">
              If you want to retake the test, we would advise that you don’t do this immediately, but rather take some
              time to reflect on the scenarios and prepare to try again.
